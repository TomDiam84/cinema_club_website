      <p class="par"><!--<img src="https://pofpa.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_9981.jpg" id="archimage">-->Iris is the most historic cinema of Athens. It has been in the heart of the city since 1930, on the ground floor of the University Club, a listed building that is a model of the modern Greek architecture of the interwar period, designed by Alexandros Nikoloudis. The building is a legacy on behalf of Antonis Papadakis with the clear term that its use focuses on the moral and material support of students, whether it concerns their needs (feeding, healthcare) or their intellectual cultivation and support for their cultural activities (theater, cinema etc.).<img src="https://pofpa.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_1132.jpg" class="placepicture" style="margin-left:60px" id="picsem"> The space has a parallel course with the Athens University Cultural Club (POFPA), under its management, which is made up of Theater, Cinema, Photographic and Dance, from which many thousands of students have spent - and not only - all these years.</p>
